Abstract:                             Background

                                      Call schedules balance resident well being, staffing requirements, and compliance with
                                      Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines. Manual
                                      scheduling is time-intensive and can contribute to inequitable workload distribution and
                                      resident dissatisfaction.

                                      Objective

                                      To develop and evaluate a constraint-based scheduling algorithm designed to improve
                                      fairness and efficiency in call distribution within a psychiatry residency program.

                                      Methods

                                      A Python-based tool using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT generated the call schedule
                                      using hard and soft constraints. Hard constraints defined holidays, PTO, and post-call
                                      rest; soft constraints optimized fairness, spacing, didactic protection, and personal
                                      “non-call” requests. Fairness was assessed by Gini coefficients and temporal Gini
                                      indices stratified by postgraduate year (PGY). The study was conducted during the
                                      2025-2026 academic year.

                                      Results

                                      Automation reduced inequality and improved schedule regularity. For PGY-2 mean
                                      Gini decreased from 0.042 to 0.012 (Δ −0.031; 95% CI −0.056 to −0.009) and temporal
                                      Gini from 0.380 to 0.321 (Δ −0.059; 95% CI −0.081 to −0.039). For PGY-3 Gini
                                      decreased from 0.110 to 0.037 (Δ −0.073; 95% CI −0.096 to −0.049) and temporal Gini
                                      from 0.415 to 0.353 (Δ −0.062; 95% CI −0.111 to −0.014). Scheduling time decreased
                                      fromby factor of ~10. Resident surveys (Nresponses-rate ~55%) showed higher
                                      satisfaction with fairness (+19 percentage points), and reduced reports of feeling
                                      overwhelmed (+19 percentage points).

                                      Conclusions

                                      The new program produced a more optimized and equitable call distribution in a
                                      psychiatry residency. This approach can be adopted by other programs and aligns with
                                      resident well-being, protecting didactic time, and systems-based practice goals.

21   Introduction
22
23   Residency call scheduling is a recurring and time‑intensive administrative task that directly
24
25   affects workload equity, resident well‑being, and program operations. Call schedules
26
27
     balance resident well being, staffing requirements, and compliance with Accreditation
28
29
30   Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines. Manual scheduling methods
31
32   rely on iterative spreadsheet adjustments and can lead to unequal call distributions,
33
34   inconsistent spacing between shifts, and scheduling fatigue for the chief resident or call
35
36
37
     committee. Algorithmic scheduling, while common in operations research, has rarely been
38
39   applied within graduate medical education (GME) or psychiatry. To address these
40
41   challenges, we developed and implemented a constraint‑based scheduling software and
42
43   compared it to the gold-standard (manual scheduling) using a quality improvement
44
45
46   approach.
47
48
49
50   Methods
51
52   The scheduling program was implemented using Google OR‑Tools CP‑SAT, a mixed‑integer
53
54   optimization solver for constraint‑satisfaction problems. Each resident‑day pairing was
55
56   represented as a binary decision variable, and the solver identified feasible solutions that
57
58
59   satisfied all hard constraints while minimizing weighted penalties for soft preferences.

                                                                                                    1

65
 1

 3
 4   Hard‑coded rules defined PGY eligibility, duty caps, and post‑call rest. Soft optimization
 5
 6
 7   objectives promoted fairness and temporal spacing by minimizing inequality, maximizing
 8
 9   inter‑call gaps, respecting didactic and non‑call requests, and minimizing repeated
10
11   call‑backup pairings. The resulting integer program typically solved to optimality or
12
13
     near‑optimality within minutes for each ~4‑month block with 3 blocks composing a full
14
15
16   academic year. A summary of constraints and optimization logic is shown in Table 1. The
17
18   new schedule created by the software was compared to previous year's schedule, which
19
20   was constructed manually with Microsoft Excel using the same 3 block method. The Gini
21
22
23   and Temporal Gini stratified by PGY level were used to objectively compare the two
24
25   schedules. To assess subjective perceptions of fairness and well-being, anonymous pre- and
26
27   post-implementation surveys were distributed electronically to all residents (maximum N ≈
28
29   24 per year). Surveys included seven 5-point Likert items evaluating perceived fairness,
30
31
32   balance, stress, flexibility, and overall well-being, with optional free-text comments.
33
34   Response rates were 50% (12/24) pre-implementation and 59% (13/22) post-
35
36   implementation. This study was conducted mainly during the 2025-2026 academic
37
38
39
     year. The Algorithm-based call schedule project including the distribution of anonymous
40
41   pre- and post-implementation surveys to psychiatry residents was determined to be
42
43   exempt from human subject’s research per institutional IRB review. No patient data was
44
45   used, and no identifiable resident information was collected.

22
23   fairness and call spacing across most PGY years (Table 2). Among primary call residents
24
25   (PGY‑2 and PGY‑3), mean Gini coefficients decreased by 0.03–0.07 and temporal Gini
26
27   indices by 0.05–0.06, representing a 25–35 % relative improvement in equity. PGY‑4
28
29   coverage also became more evenly distributed (Δ temporal = −0.08). PGY‑1 intern
30
31
32   assignments remained balanced. Confidence intervals showed consistent improvement
33
34   across the main call tiers despite a small sample size skewing formal statistical testing.

39   Lastly, the new software reduced schedule-building time from approximately 30 hours per
40
41   block (manual) to less than 3 hours. Because the algorithm automatically applied all eligibility
42
43   and fairness constraints, the call committee could focus on higher-level review rather than
44
45
46   manual troubleshooting. Program leadership also noted that the generated schedules were
47
48   easier to audit, as summary statistics on fairness and spacing were automatically available
49
50   for review, supporting transparent oversight and rapid approval.

55   Discussion
56   This project demonstrates that a constraint‑based, algorithmic approach can produce more
57
58
59
     equitable and temporally balanced call schedules than manual construction. The integration
60
61
62
                                                                                                     4

 3
 4   of hard‑coded eligibility and rest rules with fairness‑oriented optimization objectives allows
 5
 6
 7   the system to out preform an average scheduler by finding optimized solutions that a
 8
 9   manual approach would struggle to identify in any reasonable timely manner while also
10
11   removing subjective bias. Due to the small sample size available, formal statistical testing
12
13
     was limited, but confidence intervals still showed consistent and significant improvement in
14
15
16   call equity for PGY-1 to PGY-3. The PGY-4 year has the smallest number of calls and hence
17
18   the smallest sample size which likely led to the less significant results seen.
19
20
21   Resident survey findings mostly supported these objective improvements, showing parallel
22
23
     improvement in perceived fairness, call balance, and reduced stress. The largest
24
25
26   improvements in survey results occurred in perceived fairness and balanced call
27
28   distribution, which is reflected by the more objective improvement in both Gini and
29
30   Temporal Gini. Fairness and more optimized temporal spread of call likely led to decreased
31
32
33   reports of feeling overwhelmed by the call scheduled. The ease of call switching was also
34
35   drastically improved per the survey results. Call switching was difficult in the past due to
36
37   the rigid spacing and post call rest requirements between call and back-up call shifts. Call
38
39   switching likely became more accessible again due to more optimized temporal spread of
40
41
42   assignments. Interestingly, the survey results showed a small decrease in satisfaction
43
44   regarding the new software’s ability to address personal needs. Increasing fairness and
45
46   accommodating the ability to switch shifts more freely should have allowed personal needs
47
48
     to be better addressed, but the survey results disagree with this assumption. When
49
50
51   constructed manually the individual creating the schedule would likely have various
52
53   informal personal pieces of information about their co-residents, this is information that the
54
55   new software does not have access to outside of formally requested PTO and non-call
56
57
58   requests which can possibly explain the decreased survey results in this category.

 5

 7   scheduling software enhanced both measurable equity and subjective resident well-being.

10
11   allowing schedulers and leadership to focus on educational and well-being considerations
12
13
     rather than manual data reconciliation.

18   Conclusion
19
20   A constraint‑based algorithmic scheduling program produced a more optimized and
21
22   equitable call distribution with substantially less administrative effort in a psychiatry
23
24   residency. This practical innovation is feasible for adoption by other programs and aligns
25
26   with resident well‑being, protecting didactic time, and systems‑based practice goals.
